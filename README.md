This is a Node.js Nvidia Founders Edition card auto buyer/stock checker bot. It signs the user to Proshop page based on the given credentials, polls the Nvidia sku stock check api every 5 seconds by default for each card, and polls the Nvidia store api to check and update local data if the sku names change, which they likely will when new drops happen. Note: Since FE cards become in stock so rarely, this program hasn't been tested with real data. A question mark is how the proshop link that is received from the sku api behaves - whether it adds the product to the cart automatically or whether it only takes the user to the product page where it needs to be added manually. Both situations should hopefully work.

# How to run
You need to have node and npm installed. To check if you have them installed run node -v and npm -v in the command line for node and npm, respectively.

Clone the respository or download the zip. Go to the folder using cmd and first run command "npm install" to install all the depencies and then "npm start" to start the program. The program will ask to run chrome in headless mode and to create and write Proshop credentials to .env file, after which it will keep on running.
