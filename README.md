This will be a nvidia semi-auto buy bot Node.js program. The aim is to use Puppeteer to launch proshop.fi website, sign in to it, when Nvidia purchase link becomes available from the api call, launch the link and add the product to the cart associated with the account used to sign in. As far as I know, the product is reserved for a period in the shopping cart, so after it has been added, the actual purhcase process can be completed manually.
